With negative signs: 1-(-(2)) = 1-(-2)          = 1+2          = 3  and 1-(-(-2)) = 1-(2)           = -1  I see you clarified your question to say that you come from a C background. In Python, there are no increment operators like ++ and -- in C, which was probably the source of your confusion. To increment or decrement a variable i or j in Python use this style: i += 1 j -= 1          Share   Improve this answer                        Follow                          edited Sep 29, 2015 at 17:23      hjpotter92  78.5k3636 gold badges142142 silver badges182182 bronze badges                answered Jan 22, 2009 at 17:46      Greg HewgillGreg Hewgill  950k183183 gold badges11471147 silver badges12831283 bronze badges        1       3     Btw: That was a design decision from the Python creators.

They are just showing that the number is positive. There is no such ++ operator.  There is a unary + operator and a unary - operator though.  The unary + operator has no effect on its argument. The unary - operator negates its operator or mulitplies it by -1.  +1  -> 1 ++1  -> 1 This is the same as +(+(1))    1+++2  -> 3 Because it's the same as 1 + (+(+(2)) Likewise you can do --1 to mean - (-1)  which is +1.   --1  -> 1 For completeness there is no * unary opeartor.  So *1 is an error.  But there is a **  operator which is power of, it takes 2 arguments.   2**3  -> 8         Share   Improve this answer                        Follow                          edited Jan 22, 2009 at 17:58                     answered Jan 22, 2009 at 17:47      Brian R.
